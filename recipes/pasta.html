       <p>2)Put the oil, fresh and dried herbs and garlic in a skillet (frying pan) and saute the garlic until fragrant.</p>
       <p>3)Meanwhile, add the pureed tomatoes (passata) and tomato paste and stir to combine. 
        Gently simmer the sauce until the penne pasta is al dente, about 8 minutes.</p>
       <p>Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, drain the rest and add the pasta to the sauce.</p>
       <p>Toss or stir the pasta to coat in the sauce, add a little splash of reserved pasta water to help emulsify the sauce. 
        When coated add in some fresh chopped basil and stir, serve.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with 2 liters of water.
                Add 1 tablespoon of salt to the water (this helps season the pasta as it cooks).
                Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.</li>

            <li>Add 200g of pasta to the boiling water.
                Stir immediately to prevent the pasta from sticking together.
                Cook according to the package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes) until the pasta is al dente (firm to the bite).
                Drain the pasta using a colander, but save a cup of the pasta water for later.</li> 

            <li>In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
                Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant, but not browned.
                Add the diced tomatoes or tomato sauce to the skillet.
                Stir in 1 teaspoon of dried oregano or basil, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper.
                Let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>  

            <li>Add the cooked pasta into the skillet with the sauce.
                Toss the pasta in the sauce until fully coated. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.
                Let it cook together for 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to combine.</li>  
                
            <li>Divide the pasta into bowls.
                Top with grated Parmesan cheese (optional) and garnish with fresh basil or parsley.</li>  
        </ol>
